Big Data Analytics for Loan Default Prediction

## Introduction
The loan default prediction project aims to develop a robust machine learning model to accurately predict whether a borrower will default on their loan. Loan defaults pose significant financial risks for lenders, as they can lead to substantial losses and affect the overall credit ecosystem. By leveraging a dataset with nearly 150,000 rows and 30+ features, this project analyzes patterns and key indicators to identify high-risk borrowers.

The Loan Default Dataset contains a mix of numerical and categorical data. To handle the challenges posed by null values and outliers, advanced imputation techniques, such as the KNN Imputer, have been employed to ensure data quality. The project focuses on building a reliable and interpretable model that financial institutions can leverage for better decision-making.

## Objectives:

The primary objective of this project is to:

* To build a predictive model that identifies whether a person will default on a loan based on their financial attributes.
* Ensure fairness and transparency by not keeping any demographic biases.

This project provides value by:

* Helping financial institutions minimize loan default risks, leading to better risk management and financial stability.
* Offering a data-driven decision-making tool for loan approvals, which can improve profitability.
